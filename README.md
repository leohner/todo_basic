# TodoBasic

Run with `mix run -e "TodoBasic.run()"`

I know there's a lot that needs to be cleaned up. And I'm sure I'm abusing the case blocks. But it's something! 

I still need to write tests for it too. But I just wanted to get this out the door.

Thank you for looking at it! I really appreciate it.
